Yes, you can convert a previously generated .ptx file into an executable (like a.out) for a GPU, but the process involves several steps:

1. Compile .ptx to an object file: First, you need to compile the .ptx file into an object file (.cubin or .o) using the nvcc (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler). This step involves specifying the target architecture for the GPU.

Example command:

nvcc -arch=sm_75 -cubin file.ptx -o file.cubin

Here, sm_75 corresponds to the GPU architecture (e.g., for Volta architecture, replace it with the appropriate architecture version).


2. Link the object file to create an executable: After generating the .cubin file, link it with other necessary files, such as CUDA runtime libraries, to create an executable.

Example command:

nvcc file.cubin -o a.out


3. Run the executable on the GPU: Once the executable (a.out) is generated, you can run it on the GPU by executing it like any other program:

./a.out



Make sure that the CUDA toolkit and proper drivers are installed on your system and that your environment is set up to use the GPU correctly.
