To use the same seed in both CUDA and PyTorch code, you need to set the random seed in both environments explicitly. Here's how to achieve it:

Setting the Seed in CUDA Code
In CUDA, you can use curand or rand() for random number generation. To ensure reproducibility, set the seed explicitly.

Using curand: If your CUDA code uses curand for random number generation, set the seed like this:

cpp
Copy code
#include <curand_kernel.h>

__global__ void setup_kernel(curandState* state, unsigned long seed) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    curand_init(seed, idx, 0, &state[idx]);
}
In your main function, call this setup kernel with a fixed seed:

cpp
Copy code
curandState* devStates;
cudaMalloc(&devStates, sizeof(curandState) * numThreads);
setup_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(devStates, 42); // Fixed seed
Using rand(): If your CUDA code uses rand():

cpp
Copy code
srand(42); // Set the seed for reproducibility
Setting the Seed in PyTorch
PyTorch provides straightforward functions to set random seeds for CPU and GPU:

Set the Seed for CPU and CUDA:
python
Copy code
import torch
import random
import numpy as np

SEED = 42  # Use the same seed as CUDA code
random.seed(SEED)
np.random.seed(SEED)
torch.manual_seed(SEED)
torch.cuda.manual_seed(SEED)
torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(SEED)  # If using multi-GPU

# Ensure deterministic behavior (optional)
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
Syncing Seeds Between PyTorch and CUDA Code
If you're using both PyTorch and CUDA code in the same project, ensure the same seed is passed to both environments:

Define a constant seed in a shared configuration:

python
Copy code
SEED = 42
Pass it to both the PyTorch script and the CUDA kernel during execution:

For PyTorch, use torch.manual_seed(SEED) as shown above.
For CUDA, use the SEED constant in curand_init() or srand().
Full Workflow Example
PyTorch Code:
python
Copy code
import torch

SEED = 42
torch.manual_seed(SEED)
torch.cuda.manual_seed(SEED)
torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(SEED)
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

input = torch.rand(10000, device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16)
CUDA Code:
cpp
Copy code
#include <curand_kernel.h>

__global__ void setup_kernel(curandState* state, unsigned long seed) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    curand_init(seed, idx, 0, &state[idx]);
}

int main() {
    curandState* devStates;
    cudaMalloc(&devStates, sizeof(curandState) * numThreads);

    const unsigned long SEED = 42;  // Sync with PyTorch
    setup_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(devStates, SEED);

    // Continue with CUDA computations...
    return 0;
}
By ensuring the same seed is used, you will achieve reproducible results between PyTorch and your custom CUDA code.
